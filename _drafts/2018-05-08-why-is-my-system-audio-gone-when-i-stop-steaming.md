This sometimes happens if Porthole crashed or quit unexpectedly during streaming. Luckily it's quite easy to fix:

1. Quit Porthole (it might pop up a message about not being able to determine your default audio device);
1. Open your System Preferences (/Applications/System Preferences.app);
1. Select Sound from the overview;
1. Select your built-in audio device for both the Output and Input tabs;
1. Start Porthole again.

You should now be able to switch between Porthole and local audio without a problem.
