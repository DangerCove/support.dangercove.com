**Update v1.0.1 resolves this issue. Update in the app, or [download](https://www.usetimeless.app) a fresh copy.**

~~I'm investigating a bug that seems to cause the indicator to appear stuck, or not update at the correct time.~~

~~Going into Preferences and selecting the Indicator settings seems to activate it again.~~

~~This will be addressed as soon as possible.~~
