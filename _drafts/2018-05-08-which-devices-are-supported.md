Porthole works with all AirPlay compatible devices, like Apple's AirPort Express and the Apple TV 1, 2 & 3 (for Apple TVs running software v6.0, update to at least Porthole v1.4.4). But also third party AirPlay speakers, such as the B&W Zeppelin and Denon AirPlay receivers. It even works with most open-source apps like XBMC.

If you want to know for sure, just [download the trial](https://www.dangercove.com/porthole/download) first and test your setup.
