Simply disable and re-enable the computer speaker and it'll sync up. I'm still tweaking this feature. If you have a digital receiver connected to your AirPlay device or Mac, the delay might be caused by Dolby processing. As a workaround, turning it off could reduce the delay.

Also, if the problem persists and the audio also sounds distorted, make sure you've installed Soundflower during the setup wizard. To check, click the menu bar icon, select Preferences... and click Show Setup Wizard. Install Soundflower on step 2.
