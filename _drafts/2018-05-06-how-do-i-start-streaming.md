## macOS 10.8+

Starting with OS X Mountain Lion (10.8) Apple added support for AirPlay speakers. This means you can select your AirPort Express, Apple TV or other AirPlay compatible speakers as an output.

The AirPort Express called 'Danger Cove' is selected. With AirVLC you don't have to see this window, ever.

AirVLC makes it possible to set one of the AirPlay speakers on the network as the default output, without going through the System Preferences.

Just select the speaker you want to stream to. If it's an Apple TV, make sure you check the box that says 'Apple TV'. The Apple TV has a much lower delay than the AirPort Express.

If you have a multiple AirPlay speaker setup. You might want to have a look at Porthole (also made by Danger Cove) or Airfoil. They allow multiple AirPlay speakers to play in sync. Making your clips even more immersive.

## macOS 10.7 or 10.6

AirPlay for apps besides iTunes isn't supported by default in OS X Snow Leopard & Lion. Luckily there are several great apps that will help you to add AirPlay. [Download Porthole (made by me!)](https://www.dangercove.com/porthole) or Airfoil and you're set.

For this example I'll use Porthole. After installing it, there's an icon in you menu bar. Click it to see all local AirPlay speakers and check the ones you want to stream to.

Make sure the icon stays blue after you've connected and music is playing through your AirPlay speakers (try playing a song in Spotify or something).

Now, set AirVLC to 'Porthole' and drag a video on the dock icon or drop area in the app!
