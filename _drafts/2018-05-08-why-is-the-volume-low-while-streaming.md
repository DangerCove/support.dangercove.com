You can increase the volume by using the volume keys on your keyboard. If that doesn't seem to crank the volume up high enough, try the following:

1. Start streaming with Porthole;
1. Open Audio MIDI Setup (/Applications/Utilities/Audio MIDI Setup.app);
1. Select Soundflower (2ch) from the list on the left;
1. Max out all sliders for both Input and Output.
