It could be that the wrong output device is selected. For instance, it might say 'AirPlay' or 'Soundflower' underneath the 'Computer Speaker'-option. Porthole sets the computer output device on startup, so follow these steps to change it:

1. Quit Porthole completely (menu bar icon, Quit Porthole);
1. Go into System Preferences (/Applications/System Preferences.app);
1. Select Sound from the overview;
1. Select your Built-in audio device for both Input and Output;
1. Start Porthole again.

It should now say 'Built-in Output' or something similar under 'Computer Speaker' and Porthole will send the audio through that device.
