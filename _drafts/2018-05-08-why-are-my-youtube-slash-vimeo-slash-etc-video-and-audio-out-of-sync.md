The delay is characteristic for AirPlay. It's caused by the buffer that' AirPlay speaker keeps to ensure gapless, fluid playback in super high quality. It's not specific for Porthole. iTunes and iPhones/iPads have it too (if you start a song, it always takes two seconds before you'll hear it from your AirPlay speakers). Unfortunately this also means we can't fix it.

We did make a workaround for playing local videos and YouTube clips, called AirVLC. You can [get AirVLC here](https://www.dangercove.com/airvlc).
