Ranges are stored as an array of hours. The range between two numbers is shown if the current time is between them.

For instance: if the ranges are setup as 8,12,13,15,18 and it's 2.30pm, the range between 13 (1pm) and 15 (3pm) is shown.

The updated ranges are applied when you close the window. You can apply them manually by pressing return in the hour input field.
