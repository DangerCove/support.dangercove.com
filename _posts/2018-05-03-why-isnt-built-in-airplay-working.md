The first v2.1.x releases of VLC had some problems with the AirPlay audio component. This is all fixed in version 2.1.3! [Get it from VLC](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/), or update in the app.

If you're still experiencing problems, [try using Porthole](https://www.dangercove.com/porthole) or Airfoil to AirPlay the audio to your AirPlay speakers.
