Sometimes [carbon.now.sh](https://carbon.now.sh) ships an update that changes the UI. To accomodate these changes I sometimes have to ship an update that hides (or shows) the proper interface elements.

I'll mention that an update is underway on Twitter [@dangercove](https://www.twitter.com/dangercove).
