First make sure you have a working internet connection. Denied will show you a warning in the main menu if this isn't the case.

Denied checks with Spotify to see if the song contains explicit lyrics. This means the song has to be available in Spotify's library. If you're listening through Spotify this obviously won't be a problem, but if you're listening throug iTunes it might.
