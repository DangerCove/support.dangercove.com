If you're using OS X's built-in AirPlay support, you might need to up the volume for the AirPlay speakers when you start streaming. Here's how you do that:

1. Open the System Preferences window;
2. Select Sound from the list;
3. Select the Output tab and select the AirPlay speaker you'd like to stream to from the list (type should say "AirPlay");
4. Now, just drag the volume slider: 
![Increase the volume of the AirPlay device.](/images/screenshots/5s0bdvtykp40dnxlzdutiby53srhbzu7yigblkhsbvi46ucm45.png)
5. Afterwards don't forget to switch back to your Internal Speakers;
6. Use AirVLC to start streaming!
